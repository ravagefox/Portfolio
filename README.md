# Portfolio!

I have been a software engineer for all my life. My passion started when I was helping my dad with calculas engineering with Turbo-Pascal. Soon my passion developed into hardware engineering where I soon developed very quickly.
Learning all that I could so that one day, I would soon develop my skills and create my very first video game in C++ (a clone of Tetris), at only the age of 5.

And now today, I learn the top industry skills at lightning speeds, and help my team and those around me to create a top notch product.
